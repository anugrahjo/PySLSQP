# Required
version: 2

# Set the version of Python and other tools you might need
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "mambaforge-22.9"
    # You can also specify other tool versions:
    # nodejs: "19"
    # rust: "1.64"
    # golang: "1.19"

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
# To specify the path to the conf.py file, relative to the root of the project,
sphinx:
   configuration: docs/conf.py
   # Can also specify the builder type for the Sphinx documentation, and turn warnings into errors
   # builder: html
   # fail_on_warning: true

# If using Sphinx, optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF
formats:
   - pdf
   - epub
   - htmlzip

# # The conda environment will be set up first using the environment.yml file, 
# # and then pip will install any additional dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
# # The above comment doesn't seem to be correct as build failed when the following was run
# # instead of running it in the environment.yaml file
# Optionally declare the Python requirements required to build your docs
# python:
#    install:
#    - requirements: requirements.txt
#    - method: pip
#      path: .

# If using a conda environment, 
# add the path to the Conda environment file, relative to the root of the project.
conda:
  environment: environment.yaml

# TODO: It's important to note that conda and pip don't always play nicely together. 
# If we have dependencies that are available in both the conda and pip repositories, 
# it's generally a good idea to install them using the same tool to avoid any potential conflicts.
# If all our dependencies are available in the conda repositories, we might want to consider moving all 
# our dependencies to the environment.yml file and removing the python: install: section from our .readthedocs.yaml file. 
# This way, all our dependencies will be installed using conda.
