# This is necessary because the shared object file is platform specific
# and the wheel would not be installable on other platforms
# if it is marked as a universal wheel (purelib) as setuptools would do by default
# since it is unaware that the package_data is compiled 
# (since it is not compiled as a part of the setup process)

# The `bdist_wheel` class we've defined inherits from `wheel.bdist_wheel.bdist_wheel`, which is the default bdist_wheel command provided by setuptools. 
# In our `bdist_wheel` class, we're overriding the `finalize_options` method to set `self.root_is_pure` to `False`. 
# This tells setuptools that our package is not pure Python, i.e., it contains extensions such as C or Fortran extensions, 
# and therefore the wheel it creates should be platform-specific rather than universal.
